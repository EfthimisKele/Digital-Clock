# Digital-Clock
This is one of our projects for the subject "Computer Graphics" during the erasmus mobility in Universidade Beira Interior


Computer Graphics

Project: Analog and Digital Clock


Students:
Efthymios Kelesmitos a42947
Vasileios Kiosses a42946
Hakan Sariaslan a42948



DOCUMENTATION

1st week:

The first week we chose our topic. We chose digital and analog clock in C++  with the help of OpenGL and GLFW libraries.

2nd week:

We divided the project in smaller parts and we started doing our research on internet. Also, alongside we were looking and getting help from the labs.
We started writing the code .The first thing we did was to create a window where the clocks should be with the help of the 1st lab.

3rd week:

After our research, it was time to gather our resources and starting talk about how we can do it. More specifically, Hakan was responsible for the analog clock, Efthymios was for the digital clock and Vasileios was helping both projects at the same time.
First was to search about variables and methods about getting the local time and then methods to create the design of the clocks.
We faced many difficulties such as: in analog for example, some times the clock indicators were invisible or in the digital clock sometimes the time wasn’t correct.


4th week:
In this week, we discussed with the professor about our project, we showed him what we had done until that moment and asked him some of our questions. 
New tasks were created like: 
•	Using more methods from the OpenGL and GLFW libraries.
•	Writing the documentation.
•	Making the windows of the clocks responsive so the user can    have it on his main screen like a widget.
•	Uploading the 2 projects on Github.
